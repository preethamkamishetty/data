Active game literacy means the ability to understand games in-depth from a theoretical as well as a practical perspective. It includes being able to analyse existing games, design new play experiences, gain insight into and awareness of the contexts in which games are created and played, as well as understand how they can affect their players through their rules, mechanics, themes, narrative and audio-visual design.The Master's Programme in Game Design aims for a nuanced discussion through a wide range of multi-disciplinary theories and hands-on design exercises. This means the students will investigate questions such as:  I want to find another Master Course  What needs to be considered for a game to resonate with its players?How can games allow for the exploration of deep ideas and profound experiences?What are dark design patterns?What are the possibilities, but also the responsibilities, of a game designer?How can game design specialists inform the way games are seen in, and impact, society?You can choose to continue to the second year of the Master's programme for more in-depth research and preparation for a potential PhD application.","Programme Structure Courses include:Video GamesDesignUser ExperienceTheoryResearch","Academic requirements  We are not aware of any specific GRE, GMAT or GPA grading score requirements for this programme.

Games are worth studying, not merely as artifacts of advanced digital technology, or for their potential to educate, or as products within a thriving global industry, but in and of themselves, as experiences that entertain us, move us, explore complex topics, communicate profound ideas, and illuminate elusive truths about ourselves, the world around us, and each other.Career opportunitiesStudents at the Game Design MFA program from New York University study the design and development of games in a context of advanced critical literacy, with the goal of becoming game designers and developers, artists and curators, critics and scholars.

There is also space for experimental animation, immersive storytelling, docu and non-fiction animation, as well as its relevance to changing social, political, cultural and global themes.  Visit the university website for more information Drawing on the expertise of teaching staff, students learn to critically and creatively integrate their studio work with the acquisition of theoretical principles relevant to innovatory studio practice, in relation to the extensive context of animation, design, interactive media and moving image form. Students of the Animation programme from St. Joost Master Institute for Visual Cultures gain access to the formidable expertise and resources of our strong industry partners - Playgrounds, Submarine, The Panics, Ambassadors and many more, as well as connections with studios and festivals in the Netherlands and abroad.

Our alumni form an invaluable international network of creatives. Each year we offer teaching opportunities to support and build this vibrant ecosystem.Learning and Teaching MethodsThe programme is distinguished by its informal, non-hierarchical atmosphere. The didactic approach is that of the flipped classroom and double loop learning: lesson time is used not for the linear transfer of information from tutor to student, but rather as a forum for student-led discussion and constructive critique of ideas and problem solving. The undertaking of contextual research and the development of a research question(s) is essential to the verbal and textual articulation of an own personal style and attitude, and through this the curriculum is shaped according to student’s needs each year. Dedicated workshops, modules, research seminars, group critiques and tutorials, led by individual tutors or a group of tutors, support students in developing a critical toolbox of forms of creative practice, as well as the space of theoretical enquiry and reflection on topical questions relating to the wider context of animation.    Get more details Visit university website","Programme Structure Courses include:World-building & StorytellingAnimation Handwriting SOHO Project Preproduction / production Production Check out the full curriculum Visit university website","Academic requirements  We are not aware of any specific GRE, GMAT or GPA grading score requirements for this programme.
